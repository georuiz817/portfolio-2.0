              I'm a full stack developer who gained all his knowledge from not
              only independent learning but from completion of Flatiron Schools
              full stack engineering bootcamp. Now with more of a focus on front
              end, I'm a front end web developer intern over at Gesture
              (yourgesture.com) an on-demand gift delivery service, using React
              and Firebase to supplement 5000+ users and 200+ monthly orders.
              Constantly being put to the test I'm not only broadining my
              knowledge in regards to development but other key areas like
              teamwork, brain storming, and best tech practices. Looking for a
              company to call home, I've adapted well to remote work as well as
              start up companies that provide great company practices and
              small-knit communities.
